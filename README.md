### Description
A ready-to-edit template for book-style compilations (in LaTeX).

### Notes
* If you are planning to write a book-length compilation in LaTeX, then feel free to use **book-template.tex** file from this repo.

* For look-and-feel of final book, see [this PDF file](https://github.com/amberj/latex-book-template/raw/master/book-template.pdf). To be able to generate this pdf (and other output formats) yourself, make sure you have TeX and LaTeX macro package installed. Keep files **book-template.tex** and **sample.png** in the same directory and then use TeX/LaTeX tools to generate the output file. For more details, Google is your friend.

### Useful resources
* If you are new to LaTeX, I'll strongly recommend that you use [Gummi](http://gummi.midnightcoding.org/) and [LaTeXila](http://projects.gnome.org/latexila/) LaTeX editors together to edit LaTeX files. I especially like the "[Live Preview](http://dev.midnightcoding.org/attachments/download/241/gummi060-1.png)" option of [Gummi](http://gummi.midnightcoding.org/) which shows the PDF preview in real-time (correspoding to the LaTeX source edits made by the user).
